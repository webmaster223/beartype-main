class TypeHint(Generic[T], metaclass=_TypeHintMeta):
    '''
    Abstract base class (ABC) of all **type hint wrapper** (i.e., high-level
    object encapsulating a low-level type hint augmented with a magically
    object-oriented Pythonic API, including equality and rich comparison
    testing) subclasses.

    Sorting
    --------
    **Type hint wrappers are partially ordered** with respect to one another.
    Type hints wrappers support all binary comparators (i.e., ``==``, ``!=``,
    ``<``, ``<=``, ``>``, and ``>=``) such that for any three type hint wrappers
    ``a``, ``b`, and ``c``:

    * ``a ≤ a`` (i.e., **reflexivity**).
    * If ``a ≤ b`` and ``b ≤ c``, then ``a ≤ c`` (i.e., **transitivity**).
    * If ``a ≤ b`` and ``b ≤ a``, then ``a == b`` (i.e., **antisymmetry**).

    **Type hint wrappers are not totally ordered,** however. Like unordered
    sets, type hint wrappers do *not* satisfy **totality** (i.e., either ``a ≤
    b`` or ``b ≤ a``, which is *not* necessarily the case for incommensurable
    type hint wrappers).

    Type hint wrappers are thus usable in algorithms and data structures
    requiring at most a partial ordering over their input.

    Examples
    --------
        >>> from beartype.door import TypeHint
        >>> hint_a = TypeHint(Callable[[str], list])
        >>> hint_b = TypeHint(Callable[Union[int, str], Sequence[Any]])
        >>> hint_a <= hint_b
        True
        >>> hint_a > hint_b
        False
        >>> hint_a.is_subhint(hint_b)
        True
        >>> list(hint_b)
        [TypeHint(typing.Union[int, str]), TypeHint(typing.Sequence[typing.Any])]

    Attributes (Private)
    --------
    _args : Tuple[object, ...]
        Tuple of the zero or more low-level child type hints subscripting
        (indexing) the low-level parent type hint wrapped by this wrapper.
    _hint : T

    _hint_sign : Optional[beartype._data.hint.pep.sign.datapepsigncls.HintSign]

          :mod:`beartype`-specific sign, that sign.
        * If this hint is a simple class, ``None``.

        :data:`True` only if this type hint is **ignorable** (i.e., conveys

        While one might expect the set of all ignorable type hints to be both
        finite and small, this set is actually **countably infinite** in size.
        Countably infinitely many type hints are ignorable. This includes:

        * :attr:`typing.Any`, by design.
        * :class:`object`, the root superclass of all types. Ergo, parameters
          and return values annotated as :class:`object` unconditionally match
          *all* objects under :func:`isinstance`-based type covariance and thus
          semantically reduce to unannotated parameters and return values.
        * The unsubscripted :attr:`typing.Optional` singleton, which
          semantically expands to the implicit ``Optional[Any]`` type hint under
          :pep:`484`. Since :pep:`484` also stipulates that all ``Optional[t]``
          type hints semantically expand to ``Union[t, type(None)]`` type hints
          for arbitrary arguments ``t``, ``Optional[Any]`` semantically expands
          to merely ``Union[Any, type(None)]``. Since all unions subscripted by
          :attr:`typing.Any` semantically reduce to merely :attr:`typing.Any`,
          the unsubscripted :attr:`typing.Optional` singleton also reduces to
          merely :attr:`typing.Any`. This intentionally excludes the
          ``Optional[type(None)]`` type hint, which the :mod:`typing` module
          reduces to merely ``type(None)``.
        * The unsubscripted :attr:`typing.Union` singleton, which
          semantically reduces to :attr:`typing.Any` by the same argument.
        * Any subscription of :attr:`typing.Union` by one or more ignorable type
          hints. There exists a countably infinite number of such subscriptions,
          many of which are non-trivial to find by manual inspection. The
          ignorability of a union is a transitive property propagated "virally"
          from child to parent type hints. Consider:

          * ``Union[Any, bool, str]``. Since :attr:`typing.Any` is ignorable,
            this hint is trivially ignorable by manual inspection.
          * ``Union[str, List[int], NewType('MetaType', Annotated[object,
            53])]``. Although several child type hints of this union are
            non-ignorable, the deeply nested :class:`object` child type hint is
            ignorable by the argument above. It transitively follows that the
            ``Annotated[object, 53]`` parent type hint subscripted by
            :class:`object`, the :obj:`typing.NewType` parent type hint aliased
            to ``Annotated[object, 53]``, *and* the entire union subscripted by
            that :obj:`typing.NewType` are themselves all ignorable as well.

        * Any subscription of :attr:`typing.Annotated` by one or more ignorable
          type hints. As with :attr:`typing.Union`, there exists a countably
          infinite number of such subscriptions. (See the prior item.)
        * The :class:`typing.Generic` and :class:`typing.Protocol` superclasses,
          both of which impose no constraints *in and of themselves.* Since all
          possible objects satisfy both superclasses. Both superclasses are
          synonymous to the ignorable :class:`object` root superclass: e.g.,

          .. code-block:: python

             >>> from typing as Protocol
             >>> isinstance(object(), Protocol)
             True
             >>> isinstance('wtfbro', Protocol)
             True
             >>> isinstance(0x696969, Protocol)
             True

        * Any subscription of either the :class:`typing.Generic` or
          :class:`typing.Protocol` superclasses, regardless of whether the child
          type hints subscripting those superclasses are ignorable or not.
          Subscripting a type that conveys no meaningful semantics continues to
          convey no meaningful semantics. For example, the type hints
          ``typing.Generic[typing.Any]`` and ``typing.Generic[str]`` are both
          equally ignorable – despite the :class:`str` class being otherwise
          unignorable in most type hinting contexts.
        * And frankly many more. And... *now we know why this tester exists.*

        This property is memoized for efficiency.
