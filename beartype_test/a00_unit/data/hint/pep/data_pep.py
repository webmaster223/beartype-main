**Beartype PEP-compliant type hints test data.**

This submodule predefines low-level global constants whose values are
PEP-compliant type hints, exercising known edge cases on behalf of higher-level
unit test submodules.

# ....................{ TODO                               }....................
#FIXME: In hindsight, the structure of both this submodule and subsidiary
#submodules imported below by the _init() method is simply *ABYSMAL.* Instead:
#* Do everything below first for low-hanging fruit *NOT* widely used throughout
#  our test suite. This means (in order):
#  * "HINTS_PEP_IGNORABLE_DEEP".
#  * "HINTS_PEP_IGNORABLE_SHALLOW".
#  * "HINTS_IGNORABLE".
#  * "HINTS_PEP_HASHABLE".
#  * "NOT_HINTS_NONPEP".
#  * "HINTS_PEP_META".
#
#  In particular, avoid attempting to refactor "HINTS_PEP_META" until *AFTER*
#  refactoring everything else. Refactoring "HINTS_PEP_META" will prove
#  extremely time-consuming and thus non-trivial, sadly. *sigh*
#* Define one new @pytest.fixture-decorated session-scoped function for each
#  public global variable currently defined below: e.g.,
#      # Instead of this...
#      HINTS_PEP_IGNORABLE_SHALLOW = None
#
#      # ...do this instead.
#      from beartype_test.a00_util.data.hint.pep.proposal.data_pep484 import (
#          hints_pep_ignorable_shallow_pep484,
#      )
#      from beartype_test.a00_util.data.hint.pep.proposal._data_pep593 import (
#          hints_pep_ignorable_shallow_pep593,
#      )
#      from collections.abc import Set
#      from pytest import fixture
#
#      @fixture(scope='session')
#      def hints_pep_ignorable_shallow(
#          hints_pep_ignorable_shallow_pep484,
#          hints_pep_ignorable_shallow_pep593,
#          ...,
#      ) -> Set:
#          return (
#              hints_pep_ignorable_shallow_pep484 |
#              hints_pep_ignorable_shallow_pep593 |
#              ...
#          )
#* In the "beartype_test.a00_unit.conftest" submodule, import those fixtures to
#  implicitly expose those fixtures to all unit tests: e.g.,
#      from beartype_test.a00_util.data.hint.pep.data_pep import (
#          hints_pep_ignorable_shallow,
#      )
## Refactor all unit tests previously explicitly importing
#  "HINTS_PEP_IGNORABLE_SHALLOW" to instead accept the
#  "hints_pep_ignorable_shallow" fixture as a function parameter: e.g.,
#      def test_em_up(hints_pep_ignorable_shallow: Set) -> None: ...
#
#The advantages are obvious. Currently, we unconditionally build these globals
#out in an extremely convoluted process that happens really extremely early at
#*PYTEST COLLECTION TIME.* That's horrible. The above refactoring instead defers
#that build-out to *TEST CALL TIME.* Any tests skipped or ignored for the
#current test session will result in fixtures required by those tests also being
#skipped and ignored. Ultimately, though, the principal benefit is
#maintainability; the above approach isolates PEP-specific data containers to
#their own PEP-specific fixtures, which are then composable into even larger
#PEP-agnostic fixtures. It just makes sense. Let's do this sometime, everybody.

HINTS_PEP_HASHABLE = None
'''
Frozen set of **hashable PEP-compliant non-class type hints** (i.e.,
PEP-compliant type hints that are *not* classes but *are* accepted by the
builtin :func:`hash` function *without* raising an exception and thus usable in
hash-based containers like dictionaries and sets).

Hashable PEP-compliant class type hints (e.g., generics, protocols) are largely
indistinguishable from PEP-noncompliant class type hints and thus useless for
testing purposes.

Frozen set of **shallowly ignorable PEP-compliant type hints** (i.e.,
PEP-compliant type hints that are shallowly ignorable and whose
machine-readable representations are in the low-level
:attr:`beartype._data.hint.pep.datapeprepr.HINTS_REPR_IGNORABLE_SHALLOW`
set, but which are typically *not* safely instantiable from those
representations and thus require explicit instantiation here).

Frozen set of **deeply ignorable PEP-compliant type hints** (i.e.,
PEP-compliant type hints that are *not* shallowly ignorable and thus *not* in
the low-level :data:`HINTS_PEP_IGNORABLE_SHALLOW` set, but which are
nonetheless ignorable and thus require dynamic testing by the high-level
:func:`beartype._util.hint.utilhinttest.is_hint_ignorable` tester function to
demonstrate this fact).

HINTS_PEP_META = []
'''
Tuple of **PEP-compliant type hint metadata** (i.e., :class:`HintPepMetadata`
instances describing test-specific PEP-compliant type hints with metadata
leveraged by various testing scenarios).

Design
----------
This tuple was initially designed as a dictionary mapping from PEP-compliant
type hints to :class:`HintPepMetadata` instances describing those hints, until
:mod:`beartype` added support for PEPs enabling unhashable PEP-compliant type
hints (e.g., ``collections.abc.Callable[[], str]`` under :pep:`585`)
impermissible for use as dictionary keys or set members.
