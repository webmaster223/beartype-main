Project-wide :pep:`563` **cultural data submodule.**

This submodule exercises edge-case :pep:`563` support implemented in the
:func:`beartype.beartype` decorator against a `recently submitted issue <issue
#49_>`__. For reproducibility, this edge case is intentionally isolated from
the comparable :mod:`beartype_test.a00_unit.data.pep.pep563.data_pep563_poem`
submodule.

Caveats
----------
**This submodule requires the active Python interpreter to target at least
Python 3.7.0.** If this is *not* the case, importing this submodule raises an
:class:`AttributeError` exception.

        Arbitrary class method decorated by the :mod:`beartype.beartype`
        decorator creating and returning an arbitrary instance of this class
        and thus annotated as returning the same class, exercising a pernicious
        edge case unique to :pep:`563`-specific forward references.

        Superficially, the PEP-compliant type hint annotating this return
        appears to recursively (and thus erroneously) refer to the class
        currently being declared. Had :pep:`563` *not* been conditionally
        enabled above via the ``from __future__ import annotations`` statement,
        this recursive reference would have induced a low-level parse-time
        exception from the active Python interpreter.

        In actuality, this recursive reference is silently elided away at
        runtime by the active Python interpreter. Under :pep:`563`-specific
        postponement (i.e., type hint unparsing), this interpreter internally
        stringifies this type hint into a relative forward reference to this
        class, thus obviating erroneous recursion at method declaration time.
        Ergo, this method's signature is actually the following:

            def like_my_dreams(cls) -> 'Chameleon':
        '''

        return Chameleon(COLORS)

    # validate that @beartype resolves indirectly self-referential type hints
    # (i.e., parent type hints subscripted by one or more child type hints that
    # are self-references to the declaring class).
    #
    # Note that indirectly self-referential type hints *CANNOT* be properly
    # resolved for methods directly decorated by @beartype. Due to
    # decoration-time constraints, this class itself *MUST* be decorated.

        Note that this and the comparable :meth:`like_my_dreams` class method
        exercise different edge cases. That method exercises an edge case
        concerning forward references, as a method annotated as returning the
        type to which this method is bound under :pep:`563` is syntactically
        indistinguishable from a standard forward reference without :pep:`563`.
        This method, in the other hand, exercises an edge case concerning

        :pep:`563` is syntactically *distinguishable* from a standard forward
