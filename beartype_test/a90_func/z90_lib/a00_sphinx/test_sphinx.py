respect to the third-party Sphinx documentation build toolchain.

    '''
    Functional test validating that the :func:`beartype.beartype` decorator
    conditionally reduces to a noop when the active Python interpreter is
    building documentation for the third-party :mod:`sphinx` package.

    To do so, this test externally runs the ``sphinx-build`` command against a
    minimal-length Sphinx document tree exercising all known edge cases.

    Parameters
    ----------
    tmp_path : pathlib.Path
        Abstract path encapsulating a temporary directory unique to this unit
        test, created in the base temporary directory.
