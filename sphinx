# --------------------( SYNOPSIS                           )--------------------
# Bash shell script wrapping this project's Sphinx-based documentation build
# system, passing sane default options suitable for interactive terminal
# building and otherwise passing all passed arguments as is to the
# "sphinx-build" command via the "SPHINXOPTS" environment variable.
#
# This script is defined as a Bash rather than Bourne script purely for the
# canonical ${BASH_SOURCE} string global, reliably providing the absolute
# pathnames of this script and hence this script's directory.

# ....................{ PREAMBLE                           }....................
# Enable strictness for sanity.

# Array of all shell words with which to invoke "sphinx-build" below.
#
# Bizarrely, note that these Sphinx options are *ONLY* available in the short
# and long forms listed here. (This is us collectively shrugging.)

    # Generate HTML documentation.
    #
    # Note that we intentionally prefer the "html" to "dirhtml" build type when
    # locally revising documentation, despite ReadTheDocs (RTD) preferring the
    # latter. Why? Because the latter incorrectly links to directories rather
    # than HTML files in directories when generating local documentation.

    #!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
    # CAUTION: In flagrant violation of POSIX standards, sensible norms, and its
    # own bloody documentation in both "--help" text and error messages,
    # "sphinx-build" requires that options be passed *AFTER* pathnames. By
    # inspection, the autogenerated "doc/Makefile" does so. If options are
    # erroneously passed *BEFORE* pathnames, "sphinx-build" fails with this
    # non-human-readable fatal error:
    #     $ ./sphinx
    #     usage: sphinx-build [OPTIONS] SOURCEDIR OUTPUTDIR [FILENAMES...]
    #     sphinx-build: error: argument -d: expected one argument

    #FIXME: Uncomment this when caching issues inevitably arise.
    # Unconditionally rebuild *EVERY* target output documentation regardless of
    # whether the source input files providing that documentation have been
    # modified or not. By default, Sphinx only conditionally rebuilds target
    # documentation whose underlying source files have since been modified.
    # -a

    #FIXME: This appears to redundantly do the same thing as "-a" and is thus
    #currently disabled. That said, if and when caching issues arise, consider

    #FIXME: Temporarily disabled until we either resolve exactly why the Sphinx
    #"autodoc" extension is failing to generate *ANY* working references or
    #(more likely) ditch "autodoc" for something sane based on AST parsing.
    #Currently, "autodoc" fails to generate working references for even
    #standard pure-Python modules guaranteed to exist (e.g., "typing").

    # (e.g., interdocument or intrasection link).
